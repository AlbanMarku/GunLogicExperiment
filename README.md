Trying to make a gun reload system if I have nothing else to do.

What it can do as of now:

- Create a gun object with stats.
- Reload by adding missing bullets into mag.
- Reload by dumping the entire mag.
- Reloads do not fill the max capacity if there was no chambered round.
- Mag can be detached with remaing round still in chamber and fireable.
- Detached mag can be reinserted or discarded, wasting the remaining ammo.
